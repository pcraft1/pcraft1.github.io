                <p>This site exemplifies CRAP principles through every means. Beautiful use of contrast and repetition making the website clear and understandable.</p>

                <p>Exmouth View Hotel's website has poor use of alignment and contrast to say the least. The page presents as ugly and reflects that upon the business.
                    This page needs to work its color scheme and set pictures and text to align for easier viewing.
