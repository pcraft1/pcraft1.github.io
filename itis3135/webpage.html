        <ul>
            <li>Personal background: I was born in L.A. California but moved to North Carolina at an early age. Grew up around animals, lots of them. More cows than people in my old neighborhood.</li>
            <li>Professional: Worked as a temp for Cardinal Health and a few other places before enlisting in the Navy as a Hospital Corpsman. Served overseas for a few years working in hospitals and ships.</li>
            <li>Academic background: Most of my academic background is through the military which was phenomenal training but doesn't translate easily to the civilian world.</li>
            <li>Background in the subject matter of this course: Always been into computers and modding games. I enjoy the ability to control my environment and designing how everything is presented.</li>
            <li>Primary Computer Platform: I built a desktop running Windows 10 but I end up doing a lot of work on my laptop, same OS.</li>
            <li>Courses I'm taking and reason for each: 
                <ul>
                    <li>HIST1121 - My minor is History and I was missing this introductory course.</li>
                    <li>ITCS3160 - Required for major and MySQL is a skill I'd like on my belt.</li>
                    <li>ITIS3246 - My concentration is in cyber security.</li>
                    <li>ITSC3181 - Required for major and understanding something from first principles is always a good idea.</li>
                    <li>ITIS3135 - Required for major and I enjoy design.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Funny story or interesting item about yourself to remember you by:
                I met Rodney Dangerfield on a flight from LAX. Being just a kid my only frame of reference was his brief appearance in the live action movie of Casper the Friendly Ghost. As he sat behind me while talking with the flight attendant he said with a big gesture, "I don't get no respect". It would only be years later that I fully understood I just witnessed comedic gold.</li>
            <li>I'd also like to share:
                I'm hoping to make a vlogging channel that covers my adventures as a middle-aged dad.</li>
        </ul>
